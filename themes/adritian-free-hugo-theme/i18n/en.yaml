      Since I was young tinkering and taking things apart to figure out what makes something tick has always been a core pillar of my personality.<br/>
      This has grown into an neverending curiosity of exploring old and new technologies alike. <br/>

      Before enrolling in The Game Assembly I was running a company (Krafton) together with my brother.<br/>

      When the business failed in 2021 I decided to go after my childhood dream of becoming a game developer. <br/>
      
      On my free time you will find me playing or DM'ing DnD, bouldering and sportsclimbing, or going on a coding adventure.
