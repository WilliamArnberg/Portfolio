A student led Game Jam of 5 students  
The game jam was held over a 3-day period, and I am very proud of the project and what me and my other team-mates achieved in such a small amount of time.

I believe the jam went so well because all team-members cared deeply about the product we were making. </br>
Everyone was constantly playtesting and where anyone felt there was a gap in the experience they took initiative to implement something they knew would increase the experience.</br>
This iteration method and just the way we were aligned in the vision of the game made this the best game-making experience I have had. </br>

The theme of the game jam was ***Combination***.
The game won **Best-Narrative** and the **Students Choice** awards.
