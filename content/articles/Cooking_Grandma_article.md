The game jam was held over a 3-day period, and I am very proud of the project and what me and my other team-mates achieved in such a small amount of time.

The theme of the game jam was ***Combination***.
The game won **Best-Narrative** and the **Students Choice** awards.

You play as a Chef who is running a diner in a busy part of town, the chef is serving a most unusual customer. <br/>
